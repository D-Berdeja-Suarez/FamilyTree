# 🌱 FamilyTree

> *FamilyTree is a passion project that doubles as a showcase of my programming skills.*

## 🎯 What does FamilyTree achieve?

- FamilyTree provides a functional data framework along with user-friendly command-line and graphic interfaces for the purposes of recording and manipulating the history of a collection of inter-related people.

- FamilyTree demonstrates several programing tools and principles that are relevant in the context of data analysis and manipulation, such as:
    - 🧑🏻‍💻 **OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING**: Implementation of custom tools using adept combinations of Python's built-in functionality and a collection of custom classes and functions.
    - 💽 **SQL DATABASES**: Light-weight storage of persistent data in SQL databases.
    - ⟫⟫⟫ **ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS**: Favourable space-time trade-offs in the implementation of algorithms.
    - ⚜️ **STURDY SOFTWARE DESIGN**: Adhesion to best-practices and use of low over-head safeguards to preserve data integrity.
    - 🪟 **GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE**: Light-weight and practical design of GUIs for custom packages.
    - ✨ **OTHER**: Opportune hashing of custom objects based on immutable attributes, 

- With FamilyTree, you can create, maintain, and vizualize a database that records any and all of:
  - 🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒 your family history
  - 👑 the history of your favourite monarchic dynasty
  - 💬 the structure of your language's family
  - 🧐 the history of the schools of thought and religions that you find most fascinating
